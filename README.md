# FaceKeeper
FaceKeeper is a Python-based digital attendance system that uses face recognition to automate attendance marking through a simple terminal interface. It captures and registers faces, detects them in real time, and stores attendance securely in an SQLite database. Designed for accuracy and ease, it works entirely offline and generates daily reports.
